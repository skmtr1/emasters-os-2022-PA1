Good Morning Doctor. I don’t feel good.
Since yesterday.
No Doctor. Not so freely. I feel weak and do not feel like eating.
I feel like vomiting.
No Doctor, I don’t have too much water.
Yes Doctor, I took a Crocin.
No one Doctor. I took it myself.
Because I felt a headache.
No Doctor. It is enough for you to give me medicine for now.
